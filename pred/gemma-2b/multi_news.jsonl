What is known is that AFM affects the spinal cord and causes weak limbs or paralysis, drooping in the face, and slurred speech or difficulty breathing. About 200 kids have been diagnosed since 2014, and this year's figures are especially troubling. The CDC reports 121 cases of AFM were confirmed in 2014, but that was followed by just 21 cases in 2015, reports Fox News. From January to August of this year, however, there were 50 confirmed cases in 24 states. Among that first spike of cases in 2014, the Washington Post reports that 85% of kids recovered partially, but only three recovered fully. A CDC study found 68% of patients had a fever and 81% had a respiratory illness before AFM symptoms appeared. Some had been diagnosed with the West Nile virus, and others with an enterovirus. \"August to October is typically when enteroviruses circulate\" and \"we see more acute flaccid myelitis during that season,\" a doctor tells NBC News. Washing your hands and covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing are among the ways suggested to help. (Four siblings suffer from a mysterious disease.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4776}

The 442nd Regimental Combat Team was an all-Japanese-American regiment, it was formed mostly of young men whose families had been shipped to detainment camps because of their race. Still, these young men stepped forward in great numbers. The Army sought 2000 volunteers, but one historian estimates 10,000 Nisei answered the call. Basic training was hard. Some men had to go through it twice, first with their integrated units, then again in segregated units after the 442nd was formed. The 442nd, and a component Battalion, the 100th, which preceded it, joined the ranks of the most decorated regiments of World War II. Soldiers in the Go For Broke regiment gained a reputation for toughness in France and Italy. They became famous for the rescue of so-called “Lost Battalion”, a unit of Texas National Guardsmen who’d been cut off behind German lines. And Kenji Yaguchi says they captured Germans, baffled by the 442nd. The 442nd suffered terrible losses. Art Iwasaki’s company, which had started with about 200 men, was decimated to eight, by the end of the war in Europe. After the war, Ken Yaguchi became a chiropractor and settled down in Ontario.

Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years.

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first. Then get out there and hike the PCT.\" (This female hiker is the \"biggest badass you've never heard of.\")"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2416}
