Microsoft claims that the system is sensitive enough to read heartbeats and recognize individual voices. However, this raises concerns about privacy, especially if the system is compromised remotely. The first Kinect faced privacy concerns when it was released in 2010, but Microsoft denied that it would use information for targeted advertising.

The final amount will include interest and will depend on how many football seasons they worked. If a cheerleader participated in photo shoots, she could receive up to $400 per shoot. The cheerleaders had previously claimed that they were paid only $150 per game and $100 for special event appearances, and that they didn't receive compensation for weekly practices or time spent rehearsing. The attorney for the cheerleaders argued that the actual hourly pay was well below the minimum wage, and that the cheerleaders had to pay for their own hair, makeup, and transportation expenses.

The researchers used real and synthetic blood samples on the cloth to test the orientation of stains on the left side, which are supposed to represent a crucified man or a facedown corpse. However, the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. This analysis contradicts the belief that the Shroud is a genuine religious relic and adds to the evidence that it is a medieval fraud. The researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the Shroud varied with the body part. The forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees.

The charity was founded by a woman named Ash, who was inspired by a black-and-white photograph of a boy locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. The photograph was published in a newspaper and sparked her outrage and determination to do something about the injustice of institutionalising children. She wrote letters to influential people and started Lumos, which has been donating its crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996. The data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. The charity aims to shed light on the lives of the millions of children who are separated from their families for reasons of poverty, disability and discrimination. The charity estimates that the institutionalisation of children can be eradicated globally by 2050, based on the successes already achieved in several countries. The charity believes that the solution is not to improve the conditions of the institutions, but to end the practice of keeping children in them. The charity argues that it is far more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution, and that it also reduces long-term costs, since these children are far less likely to become dependent in adulthood. The charity has been working in Moldova, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and other countries, and has achieved significant reductions in the number of children in institutions. The charity has also been campaigning for the commitments made by the EU, the US and the Global Alliance for Children, which have set an important precedent for other donors.

Davis also reveals that she had an ectopic pregnancy in the past, which was considered medically necessary. Both pregnancies happened before she entered the political arena and after she had already become a mother to two young girls. Davis gained national attention when she filibustered in the Texas Senate to prevent the passing of stricter abortion restrictions. Despite considering sharing her stories during the filibuster, she decided against it, fearing that it would overshadow the events of the day.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The House of Representatives has passed a bill to fund federal agencies through December 15, but it includes conditions related to the new federal health law. Senate Democrats have rejected these conditions and President Obama would veto any changes to the law. Republicans argue that their proposal to delay the health law for a year is a compromise, but Democrats are unlikely to accept it. The Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday, and there is no plan to call them in earlier. Democrats could table amendments to delay the health law and repeal the medical device tax, but it is unclear if they will have the votes. The window for avoiding a shutdown is closing, and there are several scenarios that could unfold. A partial government shutdown could have a significant impact on the economy, particularly in the Washington region where the federal government accounts for a third of the economy. Essential services such as air traffic control and federal benefits may continue, but there could be delays and backlogs. The ripple effects could be devastating, affecting state and local governments, as well as the health of communities. The FBI, DEA, CIA, and other agencies could be affected, and there could be disruptions in national parks, passport applications, and clinical trials.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

{"pred": "\n\nMike Brown, an astronomer at Caltech, has been instrumental in the discovery of numerous dwarf planets and asteroids in the outer reaches of our solar system. However, his most significant contribution was the discovery of Eris, a dwarf planet more massive than Pluto. This discovery led to the demotion of Pluto from the status of a planet to that of a dwarf planet. Brown argues that Pluto's demotion was necessary for the advancement of scientific knowledge. He believes that Pluto's demotion was a result of its classification as a planet being based on outdated criteria. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) was forced to redefine the criteria for a planet in 2006, leading to the demotion of Pluto. Brown believes that the IAU should have considered Eris as a planet, as it shares similar characteristics with Pluto. However, the IAU decided to keep Pluto as a planet and exclude Eris. This decision led to the demotion of Pluto and the subsequent demotion of other small worlds like Ceres. Brown argues that this decision would have resulted in the consideration of hundreds, if not thousands, of potential planets. Despite the controversy surrounding Pluto's demotion, Brown does not have any regrets. He believes that Pluto's demotion was necessary to rectify the mistakes made in its classification. Brown also acknowledges that the last decade has been acrimonious, with many scientists opposing Pluto's demotion. However, he hopes that as people become more familiar with the Kuiper Belt and the discoveries made by New Horizons, the controversy will gradually die down. Brown believes that it is more interesting to study the Kuiper Belt and its objects rather than an oddball planet on the outskirts of the Solar System. He hopes that after New Horizons, the discussions surrounding Pluto's demotion will die down, and we can begin to study the Kuiper Belt and its objects.\n", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology say a giant celestial body \"lurking at the end of our solar system,\" as the Washington Post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \"Planet Nine.\" In their research published in the Astronomical Journal, the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in getting Pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as Earth, and per the AP, almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

Yo-yo dieting, or the repeated cycles of losing and gaining weight, has been linked to increased risk of poor heart health in the past, but this study suggests that it may have even more severe consequences for individuals with pre-existing CAD. The researchers followed 9,509 men and women with stable CAD for an average of 12 times over five years, and found that those who experienced large fluctuations in body weight had a 78% higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death than those who experienced little change in body weight. The study, sponsored by Pfizer, is published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, says that losing weight is important, but keeping it off is crucial. He suggests that the findings can be used as motivation to maintain a healthy weight.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

Archaeologist Giles Hamm made the discovery while surveying the territory with aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard. The find is crucial in understanding human settlement in Australia. The site also contained evidence of human interaction with mega fauna, namely the Diprotodon optatum - a marsupial measuring 2m in height and weighing more than 2,500kg. Scientists have previously puzzled over how humans had interacted with them. The presence of bones from juvenile animals in a cave on a cliff suggests they were hunted, said Gavin Prideaux, palaeontologist at Flinders University in South Australia. The find is significant because it challenges certain assumptions that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in on the globe. Until now, the oldest human tool found in Australia’s vast, arid interior has been a tiny axe fragment found earlier this year in the Carpenter’s Gap rock-shelter of the Kimberley region of northwest Australia. The tools have been dated based on a couple of estimates - quartz grains from the site have been dated to 44,000 years ago, but radiocarbon dating of the burnt eggshells, which are thought to be evidence of human cooking, revealed them to be between 45,000 and 49,000 years old. The shells are thought to have come from emus and a large, extinct flightless bird from the Genyornis genus. Together with discovery of bones of a huge, extinct wombat-like species, Diprotodon optatum, this suggests that early humans were actually interacting with Australia’s legendary megafauna. The find is, of course, controversial, because that tiny axe fragment we mentioned earlier has been dated to around the same time period - 44,000 to 49,000 years ago.

{"pred": "\nThe study conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team at the University of Michigan revealed that the incidence of colon and rectal cancers in the United States is increasing among younger adults. The study analyzed data from 1998 to 2011 and found that approximately 15 percent of colorectal cancer patients were diagnosed before the age of 50. These younger patients were more likely to have advanced stage cancer and were treated aggressively with surgery and radiation therapy. Despite the advanced stage of their disease, younger patients lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. The researchers believe that this trend should prompt the medical community to reevaluate the current guidelines for colon cancer screening, which recommend starting at the age of 50. The study also highlighted the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. The findings suggest that nearly 15 percent of all colorectal cancer patients may be caught late in the process of disease. The researchers emphasized the importance of recognizing the signs of colorectal cancer in younger individuals, such as anemia, changes in bowel movements, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The Middle Stone Age tools found at the site are the oldest of their kind, dating back to 320,000 years ago. These tools are made from obsidian, which was sourced from 25-50 kilometers away.

During this event, Apple has made several significant changes, including the removal of the CD drive in the Macbook Air and the 30-pin connector in the iPhone 5.

This decision has been met with criticism, with many mocking Apple's lack of courage and accusing them of being arrogant. The removal of the headphone jack has been seen as a step backward, as wired audio is generally considered to sound better than wireless. Despite this, Apple continues to sell dongles for the Lightning connector, and they are likely to continue doing so in the future. The company has also introduced the Apple Air Pods, which are wireless earphones that connect to the iPhone through Bluetooth. These earphones have received mixed reviews, with some praising their sound quality and others criticizing their design. Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack has also raised concerns about the future of other devices that rely on this connector, such as Square's credit card dongle. The company's justification for this decision is that space inside the iPhone is at a premium, and they want to prioritize the inclusion of stereo speakers and Taptic engines. However, this decision has been met with skepticism, as many iPhone users are unaware of what a Taptic engine is.

The surgery involved creating a pair of ears from his ribs, which were harvested and shaped into frameworks. The new ears were then grafted onto Kieran's head and shaped using a vacuum. The surgery was primarily cosmetic, but Kieran has gradually been able to hear with the help of a hearing aid. Kieran's parents, David and Louise Sorkin, were initially hesitant about the surgery, but Kieran has always wanted big ears. The surgery has brought significant psychological benefits to Kieran, who struggled with his appearance and had difficulty fitting in at school. He now has a new school with a deafness unit in every year group, which has made him feel more accepted. The surgery was made possible by the expertise of consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, who led the team. The surgery is a major operation, but it has improved Kieran's quality of life and boosted his confidence. The hospital is now working on tissue engineering techniques to create new ears using stem cells from a child's own fat tissue, which would be less invasive. This could potentially revolutionize the field of reconstructive surgery for children with microtia. The hospital is also collaborating with the University College London Institute for Child Health to develop new methods for creating ear frameworks using stem cells. The hospital hopes to be able to use stem cells to create new ear frameworks, which would eliminate the need for multiple surgeries.

Simpson, a former football star and actor, is currently serving a nine- to 33-year sentence in a Nevada prison for crimes unrelated to the 1994 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman. However, Simpson may be released by October 1 if the Nevada Parole Board rules favorably on his release request. The hearing will be teleconferenced to the board in Carson City, and if the vote is unanimous in favor of parole, Simpson will be released this fall. Simpson has been incarcerated at Lovelock Correctional Center since December 2008, after being paroled in July 2013 for the 2007 robbery of two memorabilia collectors at the Palace Station hotel-casino in Las Vegas. In his 2013 parole hearing, Simpson expressed remorse for the armed robbery and was found not guilty by a Los Angeles jury in 1995 of the murders. Simpson is now up for parole on a second set of sentences. The sentences that are aggregated for purposes of the hearing include four concurrent sentences for use of a deadly weapon and two consecutive sentences for assault with a deadly weapon. The hearings are public, but testimony is limited to the inmate, a representative of the inmate, if any, victims of the crime, and one family member or supporter of the inmate. The board will consider confidential information, including a pre-sentence investigation, a parole hearing report, a risk assessment, and letters of support or opposition. Simpson has been a model inmate during his time in Lovelock, and he has not had any incidents despite the media's portrayal of him.

Despite this, historians have been more favorable towards his presidency. His eldest son, George W. Bush, also became president, making George H.W.

He was the father of a president and a former Florida governor. He was a pilot in the Navy during World War II and was shot down but rescued by a submarine. He later married Barbara Pierce, his girlfriend at the time, and they had a successful business career in the oil-field supply, exploration, and production industries. He also served in various political positions, including chairman of the Harris County Republican Party, U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Senate, and ambassador to the United Nations.

{"pred": "\nThe news reports that scientists have discovered evidence of a massive ancient ocean on Mars, covering about a fifth of the planet's surface. The ocean was at least a mile deep and was formed when Mars was a warm and wet planet. The evidence comes from studying the Martian atmosphere and finding that the water on Mars was enriched with deuterium, a heavier form of hydrogen. This suggests that Mars lost a significant amount of water over time. The scientists estimate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean, which covered the entire surface of Mars. However, Mars was probably not completely submerged. The water pooled into a deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains. The evidence suggests that Mars was once habitable, but it is not clear if it was ever inhabited. The search for life on Mars will continue in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends a rover to the planet. The rover will look for chemical signatures of life, but there is no evidence to suggest that life exists on Mars. Methane has been detected in the Martian atmosphere, but it is not clear if it is coming from living organisms. The longer water persists on a planet, the more likely it is to provide a habitable environment for life. However, the presence of life is not guaranteed.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "\nThe Jamaican parliament has recently passed a law decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, also known as ganja. This decision comes after years of debate and is seen as a significant step towards addressing the cultural and legal issues surrounding the drug. The new law makes possession of small quantities of marijuana a non-arrestable offense, resulting in a fine instead. It also allows for the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The legislation aims to reduce the burden on law enforcement and prevent young people from being burdened with criminal records. Additionally, it opens up opportunities for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp. This progressive legislation is seen as a way to correct the historical criminalization of tens of thousands of Jamaicans, particularly young black males, and to address the victimization of Rastafarians. The decision to decriminalize marijuana in Jamaica reflects a broader trend of easing restrictions on the drug for medical or personal use in other countries, including the United States and Uruguay. The Jamaican government hopes that this change will contribute to the development of the medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the creation of innovative pot-derived products. The new law will now require further refinement and implementation to establish the necessary regulations for the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes.\n", "answers": ["Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself.

Gibson denies these allegations, maintaining that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law. The Environmental Investigation Agency has conducted independent investigations and concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood.

However, the court found that Nestle had not provided enough evidence to show that the shape was distinctive in enough EU countries. The ruling means that the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must review the 2012 decision to uphold Nestle's trademark. The outcome of the case has implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The case has also been followed closely by trademark lawyers, who see implications for brands operating across the EU single market. The case has even been mentioned in Britain's Brexit debate, with some supporters of leaving the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a beloved British treat. The Daily Express newspaper even headlined a story on the case, suggesting that the ruling could lead to an influx of copycat confectionery. The case has also been mirrored by a trademark dispute between Nestle and Mondelez in the British courts, where Nestle objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.\n", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

This move comes as the United States and China remain locked in a trade war. Talks between US and Chinese officials have done little to ease tensions. The United States has already imposed tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion, and China responded with its own tariffs on US goods worth $34 billion. A second round of tariffs on products worth $16 billion could take effect as soon as this week. The U.S. and China are trying to restart talks aimed at averting a full-blown trade war. Representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are having private conversations to find ways to reengage in negotiations. However, a specific timetable, issues to be discussed, and format for talks are not finalized. The U.S. and China have been at odds for weeks, with both sides refusing to budge. The next wave of U.S. tariffs is set to kick in as soon as Wednesday, with the possible imposition of duties on another $16 billion of Chinese imports. Officials in Beijing have vowed to respond with the same amount of tariffs on U.S. products. The U.S. is trying to secure certain concessions, and if China agrees, it is possible the U.S. will back off additional tariffs. The U.S. and China have given little recent indication that a restart to negotiations might be in the offing. The two sides held three rounds of formal talks, but negotiations broke off after the U.S. imposed tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports.

His lawyers are now appealing his conviction and death sentence, arguing that the trial should have been held outside of Boston because jurors couldn't avoid the widespread outrage over the attack. They also claim that capital punishment is unconstitutional and that Tsarnaev deserves a new trial elsewhere. The defense argues that even on social media, jurors would have seen friends and relatives posting about the bombing, which they believe made it impossible for Tsarnaev to get a fair trial. The defense also points to a recent Supreme Court ruling that casts doubt on the constitutionality of the death penalty.

{"pred": "\nResearchers from UC Berkeley have made a significant breakthrough in the field of neuroscience by developing a technology that allows them to reconstruct YouTube videos based on viewers' brain activity. This groundbreaking research, published in the journal Current Biology, opens up new possibilities for understanding the inner workings of the human mind.\n\nThe study involved subjects who spent hours inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, watching YouTube videos while their brain activity was recorded. The researchers then used this data to create a computer model that matched neural patterns with the visual information in the videos. By analyzing the changes in blood flow to visual areas of the brain, the team was able to predict what was on the screen at the time, whether it was a movie trailer or a real-life scene.\n\nThe reconstructed videos, although blurry, provide a glimpse into the mind's eye. The researchers believe that this technology could one day be used to broadcast imagery, allowing people to experience the scenes that play out in their dreams, memories, and fantasies. However, the technology is still in its early stages, and further research is needed to improve its resolution and analyze more complex areas of the brain.\n\nThe potential applications of this technology are vast. It could be used to help individuals who are paralyzed regain control of their environment by imagining sequences of movements. Additionally, it could have implications in fields such as detective work and court cases, although the ethical and legal implications of using brain activity to reconstruct memories are still being explored.\n\nOverall, this research represents a major leap forward in our understanding of the human brain and its ability to process visual information. It opens up new avenues for studying the mind and has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and understand our own thoughts and experiences.\n\nFollow-up exercises:\n1. How did the researchers measure brain activity during the study?\nSolution: The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity during the study. This technique detects changes in blood flow to different areas of the brain, providing insights into which areas are active during specific tasks or experiences.\n\n2. What is the significance of the blurry nature of the reconstructed videos?\nSolution: The blurry nature of the reconstructed videos is a result of layering all the YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity pattern. This technique allows the researchers to reconstruct the overall visual experience, but it does not provide a high level of detail. Further research is needed to improve the resolution and analyze more complex areas of the brain.\n\n", "answers": ["Scientists at UC Berkeley have made a major advancement in the field of mind reading, reconstructing YouTube videos based on brain scans from people who’d seen them.

Using the scans they were then able to reproduce the videos—though they’re blurry. “This is a major leap,” the co-author says.

The defense is claiming that the police failed to conduct a thorough investigation, and the judge is questioning whether the search warrants for Matthew's car and apartment should have been granted. The defense has also subpoenaed 14 witnesses to testify, but it took several hours for the court to grant a motion to question detective Stuart Gardner, who used his dog to track Graham's scent. Gardner testified that the dog found Graham's scent at various locations, including an industrial site and Matthew's apartment. The defense argues that the dog's findings are inconsistent with witness accounts and video surveillance evidence. The judge ruled that there were no instances of deliberate misstatements and reckless disregard of the truth in the affidavit supporting the search warrant. The trial is expected to continue, and the outcome will determine Matthew's fate.\n", "answers": ["A former police bloodhound handler told a court on Monday that during the search for UVa student Hannah Graham, the animal detected her scent outside the car and apartment of suspect Jesse Matthew—and the scent of \"fear and adrenaline\" where she was allegedly attacked.

He said the 7-year-old dog, Shaker, traced Graham's scent from downtown Charlottesville to a mulch pile at an industrial site, where the smell of fear was strongest. Matthew, 33, faces a capital murder charge in the 2014 death of Graham, whose body was found on an abandoned property around six weeks after she disappeared.

Tesla confirmed that the accident occurred while the vehicle was on autopilot. The driver had received several visual and audible warnings earlier in the drive but did not take any action.
